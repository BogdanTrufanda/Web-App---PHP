You are likely to find greeters at the church doors, so be prepared to shake hands wiht someone when you enter.
When entering, smile, be friendly and introduce yourself if you have the opportunity.
If it is crowded when you arrive, you might want to wait until the service is over to socialize.
Do your best to arrive at church on time, or even better, before the service starts.
If you do arrive late, however, be as quiet as possible and sit toward the back so you don't interfere with others worshiping.
Many churches prefer members to enter quietly and remain reverently silent out of respect for God.
Pay attention to how other people are behaving.
Before entering a church, either put your cell phone on silent or turn it off.
Don't chew gum because a smacking or popping noise will disrupt the time that people are praying or listening to the preacher or priest.
Before you go to a new church, dress appropriately, that is, dress modestly.
In the past people wore what was considered their "Sunday finest", but many congregations opted for a more come-as-you-are service.
Whatever the case, never wear anything too tight or revealing.
Find out what the policy is on children attending church before you take them.
If you are encouraged to bring your little ones into the sanctuary, give them an etiquette lesson before you leave the house.
Put a picture book or a quiet game in your bag in case your child starts to squirm.
Most families with small children are more comfortable sitting in the back in case someone needs to get up during the service.
One of the most important things you can do when attending church is to be respectful of what you're there for and others around you.
Also, being on your best behavior and paying attention to what is going on gives you the opportunity to get the most out of the service.
