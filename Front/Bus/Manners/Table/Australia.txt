Do not “play with” your food or utensils.
Tipping is a way to say thank you.
At the table you should always chew with your mouth closed and never pick your teeth.
Keep your smartphone off the table and set to silent or vibrate.
Never check calls and texts while at the table, instead, wait until you are finished with the meal and away from the table.
Do not use your utensils like a shovel or stab your food. 
Remember to use a napkin.
Wait until you are done chewing to sip or swallow a drink.
Cut only one piece of food at a time.
Instead of reaching for something across the table, ask for it to be passed to you.
Avoid slouching and do not place your elbows on the table while eating (though it is okay to prop your elbows on the table while conversing between courses).
