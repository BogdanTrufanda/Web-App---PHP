Always wear your seatbelt and insist that your passengers do.
Never drink and drive.
Driving a car requires your full attention.
Distractions, such as putting on makeup, snacking, texting or chatting on a cell phone, interfere with your ability to respond physically and mentally.
Signal your intentions, using your turn signal before turning a corner or switching lanes is a must.
Drive at the speed limit as driving too slowly can also cause accidents.
Keep some distance between you and the car ahead of you.
Tailgating is both aggressive and a sure way to rear-end someone who stops suddenly.
Only use your horn when it's really necessary.
If someone is waiting to turn into a parking space, do not steal it.
Take responsibility for the accidents you caused.
Merging should be simple and efficient.
Never double park and leave your car.
Do not place pets on your lap while driving.
Make sure you put your headlights on after dusk.
Keep your music to yourself, that is, don't let the music blast outside your car.
If you want to listen to music on high volume, roll up the windows.
Do not flick your cigarette butts out of the window.
It may be faster to exit via the opposite way, but nothing is quite as irritating as having to reverse when you find yourself head-to-head on a one-way lane, especially when you’re in the right.
Park within your own box, unless you have plans to pay for two spots.
Let the drivers trying to leave go first.
Always turn your headlights on and go gentle on the gas. If there’s one place accidents can be avoided, it is in the car park.
Don’t eat behind the wheel, it stinks up the car and it gives room for accidents to happen.
